### Patch Changes

- bb766f0: MILAB-6736: recompute clonotype-level abundance aggregates when clonotypes are merged

  Property columns marked `pl7.app/isAbundance` are themselves aggregates over samples — Supporting Reads, Supporting UMIs, Supporting Cells, Number of Samples, Mean Fraction of Reads, Mean Fraction of UMIs. They were carried over from the most abundant source clonotype, so a merged clonotype reported a single member's value while its per-sample abundances were correctly summed, and the two contradicted each other in the same table row.

  These columns are now recomputed from the block's own redefined abundances: counts are summed over samples, normalized values averaged over the samples where the clonotype is present, and `Number of Samples` taken as the number of distinct samples. Dispatch is driven by `pl7.app/abundance/unit` and `pl7.app/abundance/normalized`, so reads, molecules and cells are all covered without naming individual columns. Property columns that are not abundances keep the representative-value semantics.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 4f99fa6: Migrate block onto the structurer (block-tools structure) and upgrade the SDK toolchain: workflow-tengo 6.6.1, tengo-builder 4.0.8, model/ui-vue 1.79.6, test 1.79.10. Replaces hand-maintained config (eslint) with the tool-managed layout (oxlint/oxfmt, ts-builder check). No functional changes.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 1d0b72a: IMGT, Kabat and Chothia numbering schemes added, dependencies updates
- ba2cf30: numbering schemas and dependencies updates
